This is a flashcard application that I have created with a JS front end and Rails API for the backend. The app allows you to browse and add categories for flashcards. Once you have clicked on a category to view the flashcards you can add flashcards to that category. A flashcard has a question and an answer, and the answer can be viewed by double clicking the question. There is an option to delete cards on the bottom of each card tile.

To run this application clone this repository down to your local device and navigate to the rails backend respository. While in the Rails backend run `rails s` or `rails start` to start the server. You can then open the index page in a browser and run the application like normal.

I hope you enjoy!
